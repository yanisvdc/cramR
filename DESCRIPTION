Description: Performs the Cram method, a general and efficient approach to simultaneous learning 
    and evaluation using a generic machine learning (ML) algorithm. In a single pass of batched
    data, the proposed method repeatedly trains an ML algorithm and tests its empirical performance. 
    Because it utilizes the entire sample for both learning and evaluation, cramming is 
    significantly more data-efficient than sample-splitting. Common applications under the policy learning 
    setting can use CRAM to the same data to both develop an individualized treatment rule (ITR) 
    and estimate the average outcome that would result if the learned ITR were to be deployed. 
    The provided statistical metrics include an estimate of the average outcome that would result if 
    the learned ITR were to be deployed (policy value), along with the standard error, the confidence interval
    at the level alpha specified by the user, and the proportion of treated under this policy.

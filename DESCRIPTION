Description: Performs the 'Cram' method, a general and efficient approach to simultaneous learning 
    and evaluation using a generic machine learning algorithm. In a single pass of batched
    data, the proposed method repeatedly trains a machine learning algorithm and tests its empirical performance. 
    Because it utilizes the entire sample for both learning and evaluation, 'cramming' is 
    significantly more data-efficient than sample-splitting. Unlike cross-validation, 
    'Cram' evaluates the final learned model directly, providing sharper inference aligned 
    with real-world deployment. The method naturally applies to both policy learning and 
    contextual bandits, where decisions are based on individual features to 
    maximize outcomes. 'cramR' includes cram_policy() for learning and evaluating individualized binary 
    treatment rules, cram_ml() for population-level evaluation of predictive models,
    and cram_bandit() for on-policy evaluation of contextual bandit algorithms. 
    For all three functions, 'cramR' provides estimates of the average outcome that 
    would result if the learned model were deployed, along with standard errors 
    and confidence intervals for these estimates. Details of the method are described in Jia, Imai, and Li (2024)

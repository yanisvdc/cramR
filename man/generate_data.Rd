\title{Generate Sample Data with Heterogeneous Treatment Effects}
\usage{
generate_data(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer specifying the number of samples to generate.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \describe{
    \item{X}{A matrix of covariates with three columns: a binary variable, a discrete variable with values from 1 to 5, and a continuous variable.}
    \item{D}{A binary treatment vector of length \code{n}, where each element represents treatment (1) or control (0).}
    \item{Y}{A vector of outcomes of length \code{n}, influenced by treatment effects and random noise.}
  }
}
\description{
This function generates synthetic data with heterogeneous treatment effects across different groups.
It creates a dataset with covariates, binary treatment assignments, and outcomes based on group-specific treatment effects.
}
\details{
The covariates in \code{X} include:
\itemize{
  \item A binary variable with values 0 or 1.
  \item A discrete variable with integer values from 1 to 5.
  \item A continuous variable from a normal distribution.
}

The treatment effect is heterogeneous and is assigned as follows:
\itemize{
  \item High benefit for samples with \code{binary = 1} and \code{discrete <= 2}.
  \item Neutral effect (close to zero) for other combinations.
  \item High adverse effect for samples with \code{binary = 0} and \code{discrete >= 4}.
}

The outcome \code{Y} is influenced by the treatment effect if treated (D = 1) and random noise.

# Generate data with 100 samples
data <- generate_data(100)
str(data)  # Check the structure of the generated data

Set Model

Description:

     This function maps the model type and learner type to the
     corresponding model function.

Usage:

     set_model(model_type, learner_type, model_params)
     
Arguments:

model_type: The model type for policy learning. Options include
          ‘"causal_forest"’, ‘"s_learner"’, and ‘"m_learner"’. Default
          is ‘"causal_forest"’.

learner_type: The learner type for the chosen model. Options include
          ‘"ridge"’ for Ridge Regression and ‘"fnn"’ for Feedforward
          Neural Network. Default is ‘"ridge"’.

model_params: A list of additional parameters to pass to the model,
          which can be any parameter defined in the model reference
          package. Defaults to ‘NULL’. For FNNs, the following elements
          are defined in the model params list:

          ‘input_layer’ A list defining the input layer. Must include:

              ‘units’ Number of units in the input layer.

              ‘activation’ Activation function for the input layer.

              ‘input_shape’ Input shape for the layer.

          ‘layers’ A list of lists, where each sublist specifies a
              hidden layer with:

              ‘units’ Number of units in the layer.

              ‘activation’ Activation function for the layer.

          ‘output_layer’ A list defining the output layer. Must
              include:

              ‘units’ Number of units in the output layer.

              ‘activation’ Activation function for the output layer
                  (e.g., ‘"linear"’ or ‘"sigmoid"’).

          ‘compile_args’ A list of arguments for compiling the model.
              Must include:

              ‘optimizer’ Optimizer for training (e.g., ‘"adam"’ or
                  ‘"sgd"’).

              ‘loss’ Loss function (e.g., ‘"mse"’ or
                  ‘"binary_crossentropy"’).

              ‘metrics’ Optional list of metrics for evaluation (e.g.,
                  ‘c("accuracy")’).

          For other learners (e.g., ‘"ridge"’ or ‘"causal_forest"’),
          ‘model_params’ can include relevant hyperparameters.

Value:

     The instantiated model object or the corresponding model function.

Examples:

     # Example: Causal Forest with default parameters
     set_model("causal_forest", NULL, model_params = list(num.trees = 100))
     
```

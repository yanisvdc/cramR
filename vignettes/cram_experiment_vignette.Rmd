CRAM Experiment

Description:

     This function performs the cram method (simultaneous learning and
     evaluation) on experimental or observational data, for which the
     data generation process is unknown.

Usage:

     cram_experiment(
       X,
       D,
       Y,
       batch,
       model_type = "causal_forest",
       learner_type = "ridge",
       baseline_policy = NULL,
       parallelize_batch = FALSE,
       model_params = NULL,
       custom_fit = NULL,
       custom_predict = NULL,
       alpha = 0.05
     )
     
Arguments:

       X: A matrix or data frame of covariates for each sample.

       D: A vector of binary treatment indicators (1 for treated, 0 for
          untreated).

       Y: A vector of outcome values for each sample.

   batch: Either an integer specifying the number of batches (which
          will be created by random sampling) or a vector of length
          equal to the sample size providing the batch assignment
          (index) for each individual in the sample.

model_type: The model type for policy learning. Options include
          ‘"causal_forest"’, ‘"s_learner"’, and ‘"m_learner"’. Default
          is ‘"causal_forest"’.

learner_type: The learner type for the chosen model. Options include
          ‘"ridge"’ for Ridge Regression and ‘"fnn"’ for Feedforward
          Neural Network. Default is ‘"ridge"’.

baseline_policy: A list providing the baseline policy (binary 0 or 1)
          for each sample. If ‘NULL’, defaults to a list of zeros with
          the same length as the number of rows in ‘X’.

parallelize_batch: Logical. Whether to parallelize batch processing
          (i.e. the cram method learns T policies, with T the number of
          batches. They are learned in parallel when parallelize_batch
          is TRUE vs. learned sequentially using the efficient
          data.table structure when parallelize_batch is FALSE,
          recommended for light weight training). Defaults to ‘FALSE’.

model_params: A list of additional parameters to pass to the model,
          which can be any parameter defined in the model reference
          package. Defaults to ‘NULL’.

custom_fit: A custom, user-defined, function that outputs a fitted
          model given training data (allows flexibility). Defaults to
          ‘NULL’.

custom_predict: A custom, user-defined, function for making predictions
          given a fitted model and test data (allow flexibility).
          Defaults to ‘NULL’.

   alpha: Significance level for confidence intervals. Default is 0.05
          (95% confidence).

Value:

     A list containing:

        * ‘raw_results’: A data frame summarizing key metrics with
          truncated decimals:

            * ‘Delta Estimate’: The estimated treatment effect (delta).

            * ‘Delta Standard Error’: The standard error of the delta
              estimate.

            * ‘Delta CI Lower’: The lower bound of the confidence
              interval for delta.

            * ‘Delta CI Upper’: The upper bound of the confidence
              interval for delta.

            * ‘Policy Value Estimate’: The estimated policy value.

            * ‘Policy Value Standard Error’: The standard error of the
              policy value estimate.

            * ‘Policy Value CI Lower’: The lower bound of the
              confidence interval for policy value.

            * ‘Policy Value CI Upper’: The upper bound of the
              confidence interval for policy value.

            * ‘Proportion Treated’: The proportion of individuals
              treated under the final policy.

        * ‘interactive_table’: An interactive table summarizing key
          metrics for detailed exploration.

        * ‘final_policy_model’: The final fitted policy model based on
          ‘model_type’ and ‘learner_type’ or ‘custom_fit’.

Examples:

     # Example data
     X_data <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 5), nrow = 100, ncol = 5)
     D_data <- D_data <- as.integer(sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = TRUE))
     Y_data <- rnorm(100)
     nb_batch <- 5
     
     # Perform CRAM experiment
     result <- cram_experiment(X = X_data,
                               D = D_data,
                               Y = Y_data,
                               batch = nb_batch)

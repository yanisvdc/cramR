## Introduction: What is the Cram Method?

The Cram method is a powerful approach for simultaneously learning and evaluating decision rules, such as individualized treatment rules (ITRs), from data. Common applications include healthcare (who to treat), pricing and advertising (who to target or how much to charge), and policy (who to support).

Unlike traditional approaches like **sample splitting** or **cross-validation**, which waste part of the data on evaluation only, **Cram reuses all available data** efficiently.

A key distinction from **cross-validation** is that Cram evaluates the final learned model, rather than averaging performance across multiple models trained on different data splits.


Cram:

- Simultaneously trains a model and evaluates the final learned decision rule using all available data to improve statistical efficiency and precision—unlike cross-validation or sample splitting, which reserve part of the data for evaluation only.

- Learns in cumulative batches, using each new round of data to refine the model and check whether it's actually improving—ensuring that learning translates into meaningful gains.

- Estimates the expected outcome across the entire population as if the policy learned on a data sample were applied to everyone in the population, and not just to the data sample (statistical quantity called "policy value"), which allows the user to assess how the learned policy would generalize beyond the data sample.

> Think of Cram like a cram school: learn a bit, test a bit, repeat — getting better while constantly self-evaluating.

## The Cram Workflow

Below is the core idea of the Cram method visualized:

This procedure ensures each update is backed by performance testing, enabling **both learning and evaluation in one pass** over the data.

Note: this schematic represents how Cram estimates the difference in policy value (see the definition of policy value above) relative to a baseline policy - an example of baseline policy in healthcare would be to treat nobody (all-zeros) or to randomly treat individuals (assign 1 for treatment and 0 for no treatment randomly); the policy value difference "Delta" gives you how much better (or worse) is the policy learned by Cram on the data relative to the baseline policy - but Cram can also be used to estimate the policy value of the learned policy directly, without the need to specify a baseline policy (not presented here as part of the introduction but available in the outputs of the main functions of Cram; see result table below).


## The `cram_policy()` Function

The `cram_policy()` function in **cramR** implements the Cram framework for binary treatment policy learning.

### 🔑 Key Features of `cram_policy()`

- **Model-Agnostic Flexibility**: Supports a variety of learning strategies, including `causal_forest`, `s_learner`, and `m_learner`, as well as fully customizable learners via user-defined fit and predict functions.

- **Efficient by Design**: Built on top of `data.table` for fast, memory-efficient computation, with optional support for parallel batch training to scale across larger datasets.
 

## Example: Running Cram Policy on simulated data

```{r}
library(data.table)
# Function to generate sample data with heterogeneous treatment effects:
# - Positive effect group
# - Neutral effect group
# - Adverse effect group
generate_data <- function(n) {
  X <- data.table(
    binary = rbinom(n, 1, 0.5),                 # Binary variable
    discrete = sample(1:5, n, replace = TRUE),  # Discrete variable
    continuous = rnorm(n)                       # Continuous variable
  )

  # Binary treatment assignment (50% treated)
  D <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)

  # Define heterogeneous treatment effects based on X
  treatment_effect <- ifelse(
    X[, binary] == 1 & X[, discrete] <= 2,        # Group 1: Positive effect
    1,
    ifelse(X[, binary] == 0 & X[, discrete] >= 4, # Group 3: Adverse effect
           -1,
           0.1)                                   # Group 2: Neutral effect
  )

  # Outcome depends on treatment effect + noise
  Y <- D * (treatment_effect + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
    (1 - D) * rnorm(n)

  return(list(X = X, D = D, Y = Y))
}

# Generate a sample dataset
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000
data <- generate_data(n)
X <- data$X
D <- data$D
Y <- data$Y

```


```{r}
# Options for batch:
# Either an integer specifying the number of batches or a vector/list of batch assignments for all individuals
batch <- 20

# Model type for estimating treatment effects
# Options for model_type: 'causal_forest', 's_learner', 'm_learner'
# Note: you can also set model_type to NULL and specify custom_fit and custom_predict to use your custom model
model_type <- "causal_forest"  

# Options for learner_type:
# if model_type == 'causal_forest', choose NULL
# if model_type == 's_learner' or 'm_learner', choose between 'ridge', 'fnn' and 'caret'
learner_type <- NULL  

# Baseline policy to compare against (list of 0/1 for each individual)
# Options for baseline_policy:
# A list representing the baseline policy assignment for each individual.
# If NULL, a default baseline policy of zeros is created.
# Examples of baseline policy: 
# - All-control baseline: as.list(rep(0, nrow(X))) or NULL
# - Randomized baseline: as.list(sample(c(0, 1), nrow(X), replace = TRUE))
baseline_policy <- as.list(rep(0, nrow(X)))  

# Whether to parallelize batch processing (i.e. the cram method learns T policies, with T the number of batches.
# They are learned in parallel when parallelize_batch is TRUE
# vs. learned sequentially using the efficient data.table structure when parallelize_batch is FALSE, recommended for light weight training).
# Defaults to FALSE.
parallelize_batch <- FALSE  
 

# Model-specific parameters (more details in the article "Cram Policy part 2")
# Examples: NULL defaults to the following:
# - causal_forest: list(num.trees = 100)
# - ridge: list(alpha = 1)
# - caret: list(formula = Y ~ ., caret_params = list(method = "lm", trControl = trainControl(method = "none")))
# - fnn (Feedforward Neural Network): see below
# input_shape <- if (model_type == "s_learner") ncol(X) + 1 else ncol(X)
# default_model_params <- list(
#       input_layer = list(units = 64, activation = 'relu', input_shape = input_shape),
#       layers = list(
#         list(units = 32, activation = 'relu')
#       ),
#       output_layer = list(units = 1, activation = 'linear'),
#       compile_args = list(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'mse'),
#       fit_params = list(epochs = 5, batch_size = 32, verbose = 0)
#     )
model_params <- NULL  


# Significance level for confidence intervals (default = 95%)
alpha <- 0.05  

# Run the Cram policy method
result <- cram_policy(
  X, D, Y,
  batch = batch,
  model_type = model_type,
  learner_type = learner_type,
  baseline_policy = baseline_policy,
  parallelize_batch = parallelize_batch,
  model_params = model_params,
  alpha = alpha
)

# Display the results
print(result)

```

## Interpreting Results

```{r}
result$raw_results
```

```{r}
result$interactive_table
```


The output of `cram_policy()` includes:

- **`raw_results`**: A data frame summarizing key evaluation metrics:

  - **`Delta Estimate`**: The estimated policy value difference i.e. improvement in outcomes from using the final learned policy compared to a baseline (e.g., no treatment or treat-all).  
  - **`Delta Standard Error`** and **confidence interval bounds**: Reflect the uncertainty around the delta estimate.  
  - **`Policy Value Estimate`**: The estimated policy value i.e. average outcome if the final learned policy were applied across the population.  
  - **`Policy Value Standard Error`** and **confidence interval bounds**: Reflect uncertainty in the policy value estimate.  
  - **`Proportion Treated`**: The fraction of the population that would be treated under the learned policy.

- **`interactive_table`**: A dynamic, scrollable version of `raw_results` for easier exploration and filtering.

- **`final_policy_model`**: The trained policy model object itself, fitted according to the specified `model_type`, `learner_type`, or user-provided `custom_fit` and `custom_predict` (more details in the article "Cram Policy part 2"). This object can be used for further analysis or for applying the learned policy to new data.

```{r}
class(result$final_policy_model)
summary(result$final_policy_model)

```

You can inspect or apply the learned model to new data.

## Visual Summary and Notes

![ ](cram_visual_2.png)


This visualization summarizes how multiple evaluations across iterations contribute to the full Cram estimate.

Notes:

- **Batching**: You can pass a number (e.g., `batch = 5`) or a custom vector to control how data is split.  
- **Parallelization**: Enable with `parallelize_batch = TRUE`.  
- **Custom Learners**: Use `custom_fit` and `custom_predict` to plug in any estimator. (more details in the article "Cram Policy part 2")

## Why Cram?

Compared to classic learning and evaluation methods, in terms of data usage for both learning and evaluation: 

| Method            | Learning | Evaluation        | Data Usage Overall       |
|-------------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Sample Splitting  | Partial  | Partial           | ❌ Inefficient    |
| Cross-Validation  | Partial  | Final model not evaluated directly, average performance across fold-specific models used as proxy  | ⚠️ Partial for each fold-specific model  |
| **Cram**          | ✅ Full  | ✅ Final model evaluated directly using all data |✅ Fully reused for both learning and evaluation |

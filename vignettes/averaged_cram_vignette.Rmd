Averaged CRAM with Permutations

Description:

     This function implements Averaged CRAM by randomly permuting
     batches (except the last batch which is kept the same) and
     averaging performance results.

Usage:

     averaged_cram(
       X,
       D,
       Y,
       batch,
       model_type,
       learner_type = NULL,
       alpha = 0.05,
       baseline_policy = NULL,
       parallelize_batch = FALSE,
       model_params = NULL,
       custom_fit = NULL,
       custom_predict = NULL,
       num_permutations = 10
     )
     
Arguments:

       X: A matrix or data frame of covariates.

       D: A binary vector of treatment indicators (0 or 1).

       Y: A vector of outcomes.

   batch: Either an integer specifying the number of batches (which
          will be created by random sampling) or a vector of length
          equal to the sample size providing the batch assignment
          (index) for each individual in the sample.

model_type: The model type for policy learning. Options include
          ‘"causal_forest"’, ‘"s_learner"’, and ‘"m_learner"’. Default
          is ‘"causal_forest"’.

learner_type: The learner type for the chosen model. Options include
          ‘"ridge"’ for Ridge Regression and ‘"fnn"’ for Feedforward
          Neural Network. Default is ‘"ridge"’.

   alpha: Significance level for confidence intervals. Default is 0.05
          (95% confidence).

baseline_policy: A list providing the baseline policy (binary 0 or 1)
          for each sample. If ‘NULL’, defaults to a list of zeros with
          the same length as the number of rows in ‘X’.

parallelize_batch: Logical. Whether to parallelize batch processing
          (i.e. the cram method learns T policies, with T the number of
          batches. They are learned in parallel when parallelize_batch
          is TRUE vs. learned sequentially using the efficient
          data.table structure when parallelize_batch is FALSE,
          recommended for light weight training). Defaults to ‘FALSE’.

model_params: A list of additional parameters to pass to the model,
          which can be any parameter defined in the model reference
          package. Defaults to ‘NULL’.

custom_fit: A custom, user-defined, function that outputs a fitted
          model given training data (allows flexibility). Defaults to
          ‘NULL’.

custom_predict: A custom, user-defined, function for making predictions
          given a fitted model and test data (allow flexibility).
          Defaults to ‘NULL’.

num_permutations: Number of random permutations of batches.

Value:

     A list with averaged performance and variance estimates.

Examples:

     X <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10)
     D <- sample(0:1, 100, replace = TRUE)
     Y <- rnorm(100)
     avg_cram_results <- averaged_cram(X, D, Y,
                                       batch = 20,
                                       model_type = "m_learner",
                                       learner_type = "ridge",
                                       num_permutations = 3)
     
```

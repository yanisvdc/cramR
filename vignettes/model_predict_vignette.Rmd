# Documentation for `model_predict`
```
Predict with the Specified Model

Description:

     This function performs inference using a trained model, providing
     flexibility for different types of models such as Causal Forest,
     Ridge Regression, and Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs).

Usage:

     model_predict(model, X, D = NULL, model_type, learner_type, model_params)
     
Arguments:

   model: A trained model object returned by the `fit_model` function.

       X: A matrix or data frame of covariates for which predictions
          are required.

       D: A vector of binary treatment indicators (1 for treated, 0 for
          untreated). Optional, depending on the model type.

model_type: The model type for policy learning. Options include
          ‘"causal_forest"’, ‘"s_learner"’, and ‘"m_learner"’. Default
          is ‘"causal_forest"’.

learner_type: The learner type for the chosen model. Options include
          ‘"ridge"’ for Ridge Regression and ‘"fnn"’ for Feedforward
          Neural Network. Default is ‘"ridge"’.

model_params: A list of additional parameters to pass to the model,
          which can be any parameter defined in the model reference
          package. Defaults to ‘NULL’.

Value:

     A vector of predictions or CATE estimates, depending on the
     ‘model_type’ and ‘learner_type’.

Examples:

     # Load required library
     library(grf)
     
     # Example: Predicting with a Causal Forest model
     set.seed(123)
     X <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10)  # Covariates
     Y <- rnorm(100)                                 # Outcomes
     D <- sample(0:1, 100, replace = TRUE)           # Treatment indicators
     cf_model <- causal_forest(X, Y, D)             # Train Causal Forest
     new_X <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10, ncol = 10) # New data for predictions
     predictions <- model_predict(model = cf_model, X = new_X, model_type = "causal_forest")

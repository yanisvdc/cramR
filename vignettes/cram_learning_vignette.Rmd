CRAM Learning

Description:

     This function performs the learning part of the cram method.

Usage:

     cram_learning(
       X,
       D,
       Y,
       batch,
       model_type = "causal_forest",
       learner_type = "ridge",
       baseline_policy = NULL,
       parallelize_batch = FALSE,
       model_params = NULL,
       custom_fit = NULL,
       custom_predict = NULL
     )
     
Arguments:

       X: A matrix or data frame of covariates for each sample.

       D: A vector of binary treatment indicators (1 for treated, 0 for
          untreated).

       Y: A vector of outcome values for each sample.

   batch: Either an integer specifying the number of batches (which
          will be created by random sampling) or a vector of length
          equal to the sample size providing the batch assignment
          (index) for each individual in the sample.

model_type: The model type for policy learning. Options include
          ‘"causal_forest"’, ‘"s_learner"’, and ‘"m_learner"’. Default
          is ‘"causal_forest"’.

learner_type: The learner type for the chosen model. Options include
          ‘"ridge"’ for Ridge Regression and ‘"fnn"’ for Feedforward
          Neural Network. Default is ‘"ridge"’.

baseline_policy: A list providing the baseline policy (binary 0 or 1)
          for each sample. If ‘NULL’, the baseline policy defaults to a
          list of zeros with the same length as the number of rows in
          ‘X’.

parallelize_batch: Logical. Whether to parallelize batch processing
          (i.e. the cram method learns T policies, with T the number of
          batches. They are learned in parallel when parallelize_batch
          is TRUE vs. learned sequentially using the efficient
          data.table structure when parallelize_batch is FALSE,
          recommended for light weight training). Defaults to ‘FALSE’.

model_params: A list of additional parameters to pass to the model,
          which can be any parameter defined in the model reference
          package. Defaults to ‘NULL’.

custom_fit: A custom, user-defined, function that outputs a fitted
          model given training data (allows flexibility). Defaults to
          ‘NULL’.

custom_predict: A custom, user-defined, function for making predictions
          given a fitted model and test data (allow flexibility).
          Defaults to ‘NULL’.

Value:

     A list containing:

final_policy_model: The final fitted policy model, depending on
          ‘model_type’ and ‘learner_type’.

policies: A matrix of learned policies, where each column represents a
          batch's learned policy and the first column is the baseline
          policy.

batch_indices: The indices for each batch, either as generated (if
          ‘batch’ is an integer) or as provided by the user.

     ‘causal_forest’, ‘cv.glmnet’, ‘keras_model_sequential’

Examples:

     # Example usage
     X_data <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 5), nrow = 100, ncol = 5)
     D_data <- sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = TRUE)
     Y_data <- rnorm(100)
     nb_batch <- 5
     
     # Perform CRAM learning
     result <- cram_learning(X = X_data, D = D_data, Y = Y_data, batch = nb_batch)
     
     # Access the learned policies and final model
     policies_matrix <- result$policies
     final_model <- result$final_policy_model
     batch_indices <- result$batch_indices
     
```

CRAM Simulation

Description:

     This function performs the cram method (simultaneous learning and
     evaluation) on simulation data, for which the data generation
     process (DGP) is known. The data generation process for X can be
     given directly as a function or induced by a provided dataset via
     row-wise bootstrapping. Results are averaged across Monte Carlo
     replicates for the given DGP.

Usage:

     cram_simulation(
       X = NULL,
       dgp_X = NULL,
       dgp_D,
       dgp_Y,
       batch,
       nb_simulations,
       nb_simulations_truth = NULL,
       sample_size,
       model_type = "causal_forest",
       learner_type = "ridge",
       alpha = 0.05,
       baseline_policy = NULL,
       parallelize_batch = FALSE,
       model_params = NULL,
       custom_fit = NULL,
       custom_predict = NULL
     )
     
Arguments:

       X: Optional. A matrix or data frame of covariates for each
          sample inducing empirically the DGP for covariates.

   dgp_X: Optional. A function to generate covariate data for
          simulations.

   dgp_D: A vectorized function to generate binary treatment
          assignments for each sample.

   dgp_Y: A vectorized function to generate the outcome variable for
          each sample given the treatment and covariates.

   batch: Either an integer specifying the number of batches (which
          will be created by random sampling) or a vector of length
          equal to the sample size providing the batch assignment
          (index) for each individual in the sample.

nb_simulations: The number of simulations (Monte Carlo replicates) to
          run.

nb_simulations_truth: Optional. The number of additional simmulations
          (Monte Carlo replicates) beyond nb_simulations to use when
          calculating the true policy value difference (delta) and the
          true policy value (psi)

sample_size: The number of samples in each simulation.

model_type: The model type for policy learning. Options include
          ‘"causal_forest"’, ‘"s_learner"’, and ‘"m_learner"’. Default
          is ‘"causal_forest"’.

learner_type: The learner type for the chosen model. Options include
          ‘"ridge"’ for Ridge Regression and ‘"fnn"’ for Feedforward
          Neural Network. Default is ‘"ridge"’.

   alpha: Significance level for confidence intervals. Default is 0.05
          (95% confidence).

baseline_policy: A list providing the baseline policy (binary 0 or 1)
          for each sample. If ‘NULL’, defaults to a list of zeros with
          the same length as the number of rows in ‘X’.

parallelize_batch: Logical. Whether to parallelize batch processing
          (i.e. the cram method learns T policies, with T the number of
          batches. They are learned in parallel when parallelize_batch
          is TRUE vs. learned sequentially using the efficient
          data.table structure when parallelize_batch is FALSE,
          recommended for light weight training). Defaults to ‘FALSE’.

model_params: A list of additional parameters to pass to the model,
          which can be any parameter defined in the model reference
          package. Defaults to ‘NULL’.

custom_fit: A custom, user-defined, function that outputs a fitted
          model given training data (allows flexibility). Defaults to
          ‘NULL’.

custom_predict: A custom, user-defined, function for making predictions
          given a fitted model and test data (allow flexibility).
          Defaults to ‘NULL’.

Value:

     A list containing:

     ‘avg_proportion_treated’ The average proportion of treated
          individuals across simulations.

     ‘avg_delta_estimate’ The average delta estimate across
          simulations.

     ‘avg_delta_standard_error’ The average standard error of delta
          estimates.

     ‘delta_empirical_bias’ The empirical bias of delta estimates.

     ‘delta_empirical_coverage’ The empirical coverage of delta
          confidence intervals.

     ‘avg_policy_value_estimate’ The average policy value estimate
          across simulations.

     ‘avg_policy_value_standard_error’ The average standard error of
          policy value estimates.

     ‘policy_value_empirical_bias’ The empirical bias of policy value
          estimates.

     ‘policy_value_empirical_coverage’ The empirical coverage of policy
          value confidence intervals.

Examples:

     # Define data generation process (DGP) functions
     X_data <- data.table::data.table(
       binary = rbinom(100, 1, 0.5),                 # Binary variable (0 or 1)
       discrete = sample(1:5, 100, replace = TRUE),  # Discrete variable (1 to 5)
       continuous = rnorm(100)                       # Continuous variable
     )
     dgp_D <- function(X) rbinom(nrow(X), 1, 0.5)
     dgp_Y <- function(D, X) { theta <- ifelse(
     X[, binary] == 1 & X[, discrete] <= 2,  # Group 1: High benefit
     1,
     ifelse(X[, binary] == 0 & X[, discrete] >= 4,  # Group 3: High adverse effect
     -1,
     0.1)  # Group 2: Neutral effect
     )
     Y <- D * (theta + rnorm(length(D), mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
       (1 - D) * rnorm(length(D))  # Outcome for untreated
     
     return(Y)
     }
     
     # Parameters:
     nb_simulations <- 10
     nb_simulations_truth <- 2

     # Perform CRAM simulation
